# nvim-config

My config for Neovim on top of [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/). It suits me, but it might suit you, too!

## How to use

Clone this repo into your `~/.config/nvim`:

```
git clone https://github.com/bradpurchase/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

## Grep

Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for livegrep (`<leader><leader>`):

```
brew install ripgrep
```

or:

```
sudo apt-get install ripgrep
```

## Git

Install [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) for a nice git UI (`<leader>gg`):

```
brew install lazygit
```

or:

```
sudo apt install lazygit
```

The lazygit [plugin](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim) for Neovim is already installed, so you should be fine after you restart `nvim` after installing.
